ðŸ“š Description: The Tiny Shop Sales SQL Case Study is a hands-on project designed to challenge our SQL skills and deepen our understanding of database management. In this project, we'll be exploring a database schema consisting of four tables: customers, products, orders, and order_items. Each table contains relevant columns to capture customer details, product information, order details, and order item specifics.

ðŸ’¡ Overview: This case study uses PostgreSQL. To successfully answer all the questions you should have been exposed to the following areas of SQL:

* Basic aggregations
* CASE WHEN statements
* Window Functions
* Joins
* Date time functions
* CTEs

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective:
The main objective of this case study is to apply various SQL concepts and techniques to answer a set of insightful questions about the Tiny Shop Sales data. Some of the key objectives include:

1) Which product has the highest price? Only return a single row.
2) Which customer has made the most orders?
3) Whatâ€™s the total revenue per product?
4) Find the day with the highest revenue.
5) Find the first order (by date) for each customer.
6) Find the top 3 customers who have ordered the most distinct products
7) Which product has been bought the least in terms of quantity?
8) What is the median order total?
9) For each order, determine if it was â€˜Expensiveâ€™ (total over 300), â€˜Affordableâ€™ (total over 100), or â€˜Cheapâ€™.
10) Find customers who have ordered the product with the highest price.
